# Questions
1. In the thesis, Mehedi mentioned that LIBXSMM is threading-runtime agnostic. What is the significance of this?
2. How should we deal with the non-deterministics during the testing process:
    - OS -> context switching
    - Matrix size -> cache usages
    - Clock speed -> CPU temp (if the other cores are heavily loaded)

    Mehedi use `gettimeofday` to measure the cpu time for the small MM computation. Should we use `perf ` to count the cpu cycles.
