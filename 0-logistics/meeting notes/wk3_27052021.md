# Agenda
## Tasks completed for the past week

1. Finish Mehedi's thesis
2. Finish the LIBXSMM paper
3. Read through the LIBXSMM doc
4. Finished 50% of the progress report - still a lot to write

## Plan for the near weeks

1. Try to recreate Mehedi's experiment
2. More readings:
    - GiMMiK
    - Optimisation for general GEMM
3. LIBXSMM's code generator

## Things I would like to discuss today

1. Progress report draft
2. Potential direction for MM on ARM?

# Meeting notes

## ARM architectures

- ARM has neon vector instruction set - should be available for all ARM processors
- Newer instruction set: ARM SVE - only one computer has it - Fugaku
- SVE access possible via U of Bristol
- All ARM instruction sets have same length

## Pre-matured optimisation
- Optimisation before appropriate evaluation method
- Make things work first

## Ideas about JIT
- Alex know a lot about JIT
- Historically JIT are slow
- LIBXSMM is astonishing fast
- LLVM much more slower than LIBXSMM
